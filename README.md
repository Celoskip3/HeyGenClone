  Welcome to <strong>HeyGenClone</strong>, an open-source analogue of the HeyGen system.
</p>

<p>
  I am a developer from Moscow ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º who devotes his free time to studying new technologies. The project is in an active development phase, but I hope it will help you achieve your goals!

## Installation
- Clone this repo
- Install requirements:
  ```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- In config.json file change HF_TOKEN argument. It is your HuggingFace token. Visit [speaker-diarization](https://hf.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization), [segmentation](https://hf.co/pyannote/segmentation) and accept user conditions
- Download weights from [drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e35OvOlWVNndkx0Gv7zc5emwnX7t3Oc4/view?usp=sharing), unzip downloaded file into <strong>weights</strong> folder
- Install ffmpeg

## Usage
At the root of the project there is a translate script that translates the movie you set.
```
python translate.py video_filename output_language -o output_filename
```

## How it works
1. Detecting scenes ([PySceneDetect](https://github.com/Breakthrough/PySceneDetect))
2. Face detection ([yolov8-face](https://github.com/akanametov/yolov8-face))
3. Reidentification ([deepface](https://github.com/serengil/deepface))
4. Voice cloning ([TTS](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS))
5. Lip sync ([lipsync](https://github.com/mowshon/lipsync))
6. [Need to fix] Search for talking faces, determining what this person is saying

## Conversion results
| Src lang (detected) | Dst lang | Src video | Final video |
|     :---:      |     :---:      |     :---:     |     :---:      |
